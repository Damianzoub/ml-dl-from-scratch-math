# ml-dl-from-scratch-math
This repository is a personal project designed to delve into the inner workings of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. By implementing these algorithms from scratch, the focus is on understanding their mathematical foundations, step-by-step derivations, and practical applications. This hands-on approach aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their real-world implementations.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to enhance my comprehension of the core principles and mechanics underlying ML and DL. By constructing these algorithms from the ground up, I aim to solidify my mathematical understanding, improve my coding skills, and develop a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of these technologies.

## Contents
This repository includes the following topics:
- **Linear Regression**: Mathematical derivation and implementation for predictive modeling.
- **Logistic Regression**: Understanding binary classification through gradient descent.
- **Neural Networks**: Step-by-step construction and training of simple neural networks.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Exploration of gradient descent, momentum, and Adam optimizers.
- **Matrix Operations**: Fundamental linear algebra concepts essential for ML/DL.
- **Loss Functions**: Analysis of common loss functions and their roles in optimization.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended solely for personal learning and exploration. The implementations prioritize clarity and educational value over computational efficiency or scalability. It is not designed for production use or deployment in real-world systems.

## How to Use
